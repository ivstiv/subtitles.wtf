Where To Find Subtitles? Hence, the domain.. :D Honestly, I made this app just because I thought it would be e a cool acronym for its purpose! All props go to the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com) and [Open Subtitles API](https://www.opensubtitles.com/) as the upstream data is served by them.

## Development

To run the app locally, you need to have `pnpm` installed. Then, you can install the dependencies and start the development server with:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

__Check package.json for other scripts__
